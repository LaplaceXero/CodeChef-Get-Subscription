# CodeChef-Get-Subscription

Problem
Chef wants to conduct a lecture for which he needs to set up an online meeting of exactly XX minutes.

The meeting platform supports a meeting of maximum 30 minutes without subscription and a meeting of unlimited duration with subscription.

Determine whether Chef needs to take a subscription or not for setting up the meet.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains a single integer XX - denoting the duration of the lecture.
Output Format
For each test case, print in a single line, YES if Chef needs to take the subscription, otherwise print NO.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
